            <p>You tried parkouring, you did a really bad jump and ended up falling off the hotel's roof, probably broke a bone or two. As you lay there suffering for acting stupid in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, the noise you made when you fell alerted zombies nearby which then came up to you and killed you.</p>
